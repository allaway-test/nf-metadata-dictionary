### Maintenance and Contribution

The purpose of the metadata dictionary is to provide a set of standard terms to describe data. 
This dictionary is maintained by the NF-Open Science Initative. We welcome contributions from community members, whether you are a professional data modeler, clinician, or student in the NF community.

### Steps to add an attribute to the Metadata Dictionary: 
<ins>**Steps 1 - 6 are performed by a "contributor" or "maintainer"**</ins>

1. Create a new [branch](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/branches) in the NF-metadata-dictionary repository. (example: patch/add-attribute)
2. Find the csv file in the new branch where the attribute belongs.  The components of the data model are organized in the folder labled[modules](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/tree/main/modules).

_e.g. As shown bellow, in [modules/Assay](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/tree/main/modules/Assay) there are classes associated with assays: Assay, Assay_Parameter, Platform, etc.and the relations csv file, annotationProperty._

3. Add the attribute to the relevant csv file by either 1) <ins>â†“</ins> downloading the csv file , editing in excel and reuploading or 2) editing the raw csv.

_The raw csv file looks like this_

4. Complete the columns for the attribute and "commit changes" to the new branch. At a minimum, add **Attribute**, **Description**, **Valid Values** and **Source** - 
If you need help, the maintainer will help fill out the rest after you do a pull request.

 Attribute*** | Description*** | Valid Values | Source***
---|---|---|---
 Name of the new concept | A description for the concept.   | Only required if you are editing an annotationProperty.csv file, where you would be defining a new field (relation) and specifying what values are allowed to be used with this field (relation). For example, _tumorType_ is to valid values _{ Malignant Peripheral Sheath Tumor, Schwannoma, ... }_ as _eats_ is to valid values _{ pizza, sandwich, egg, ... }_.  | Preferably a URI to an ontology source term

*** = Required

5. Add the attribute under "Valid Values" for any other attributes it pertains to. 
6. Create a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/compare) to merge the branch to "main". Add either @allaway, @anngvu, or @cconrad8 as a reviewer. Creating the PR will perform an action to update the [NF.csv](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/blob/main/NF.csv) file and the [NF.jsonld](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/blob/main/NF.jsonld) from the modules folder. **Therefore, you do not need to edit the `NF.csv` or `NF.jsonld` directly because it will be done automatically**

<ins>**Steps 7-9 are performed only by the "maintainer"**</ins>

7. The maintainer will make any neccessary changes and then merge the new branch that was created to the main branch. 
8. The maintainer will [Draft a versioned release here](https://github.com/nf-osi/nf-metadata-dictionary/releases).
9. Name the release with the the convention MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. These releases start at v1.0.0. Versioning is roughly following [semantic versioning](semver.org) concepts where: 

* MAJOR: *In-use* parent attributes are deleted from dictionary or modified, or in-use child attributes are modified in a non-backwards compatible way    (e.g. `Neurofibromatosis 1` changed to `Neurofibromatosis type 1`). 
* MINOR: Concepts/parent attributes are added. 
* PATCH: Child attributes are added, or *unused* child/parent attributes are deleted/modified, or definitions/`comments` are added/modified, or `validation rules` are modified in a backwards compatible way. 

10. The term is now added to the [metadata dictionary](https://nf-osi.github.io/nf-metadata-dictionary) and is also accessible in manifests in the [data curator app](https://sagebio.shinyapps.io/NF_data_curator/).

#### Further Information

#### Building Locally
For building locally, you will need to install the [schematic](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic) package. 
After adding a term, you can test whether the model "builds" by running `make CSV=NF.csv`.
But you do not have to build locally as we also have a GitHub Action workflow that will build any changes in `Modules/**` (this makes it easier for one-off contributions).
