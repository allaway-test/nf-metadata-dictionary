    description: >
      A scientific project of some planned duration with PIs and key contributors, specific research topics, and potential publication/data/other outputs. 
      A study is often represented as a Synapse project and so is also referred to as "project".
      The study schema here is specifically for studies listed on the NF Portal at https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Studies.
    notes:
    - There are small differences for the public portal representation of study vs. elsewhere such as in the less-public data sharing plan, but it should always be possible to translate DSP rep to the portal study rep.
