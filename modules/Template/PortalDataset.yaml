  PortalDataset:
    description: >
      A slightly more specialized dataset concept intended for the specific scope of the NF Portal; see https://nf.synapse.org/Explore/Datasets. 
    notes:
    - The compiled JSON schema for this should be bound to [Dataset](https://rest-docs.synapse.org/rest/org/sagebionetworks/repo/model/table/Dataset.html) entities, not folders. 
    - While "publisher" (repository) may seem redundant given that all Datasets are obviously on Synapse, it's for explicit compatibility with DataCite, and eventually may want to have "symbolic" datasets like Cancer Complexity Portal that list datasets hosted somewhere else.
    attributes:
    # Meta set by Synapse/not editable as annotations are commented out but included for reference bc they do show up in the portal
    # - name
    # - id
    # - currentVersion
    # - doi (if minted)
    # - createdBy # user id/handle, creator allows setting name more explicitly for citations
    # - datasetItemCount
    # - datasetSizeInBytes 
    # - publisher # should be autoset as Synapse
